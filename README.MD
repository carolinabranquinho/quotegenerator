# Random Quote Machine

This challenge was proposed by freeCodeCamp. My solution is also available in my codePen profile, can be access through this [link](https://codepen.io/carolinabranquinho/pen/PoNqMzm).

## Technologies used

This challenge was made to test the knowledge in front end libraries and frameworks.

I choose made this app in HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery.

- **Bootstrap**

Bootstrap is a CSS framework directed at responsive and mobile-first front-end web development.
This was my first time using this important and very famous framework. My layout is very simple but was great to make him with bootstrap, helped a lot! It was used by CDN in my project.

- **JQuery**

JQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree, event handling, CSS animation and AJAX. I used AJAX to make requisition to the quote API, some event handling like .text() to write the messages and some animation too.
